# Features

## Modular core
Kreato Linux's modular building tools allow you to mix-and-match components and create your own unique setup.

Unlike other distributions, Kreato Linux does not have a `base` package. You create your own base, with the choices provided by the Kreastrap tool, that allows you to build the system.

Our goal is to provide the most modular Linux system to exist. Most tools of Kreato Linux are built with portability in mind for this very reason.

## Jumpstart
Jumpstart is Kreato Linux's default init system, written in Nim. It allows as much modularity as possible to the user, while being minimal and easy-to-use.

Jumpstart is inspired from init systems such as systemd.

Nothing is stopping you from using other init systems, such as systemd and OpenRC.

## Source/Binary hybrid package manager
Kreato Linux uses kpkg, a package manager written in Nim that gives you the choice of building or installing binaries with ease. This way you can choose what's best for your usecase.

Kpkg is fast, and simple. It supports scripts named runfiles that allow you to easyly write packages, similar to other script-based formats. You can learn more about it from the kpkg_run(5) manpage.

## Good documentation
Kreato Linux uses manpages for its documentation. A documentation webpage is also available. Manpages are constantly updated and the code has been written in a way to be understandable.

Documentation is available [here](./docs).

## Independent
Kreato Linux is independent and is maintained by a single person. This means the functions of the distribution is made as easy to maintain as possible. 

Tools such as [chkupd](https://github.com/kreatolinux/src#chkupd) allow Kreato Linux to be easy to maintain for a single person.
